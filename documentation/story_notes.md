## Research Questions

* Explain how QCEW location quotients show how these 10 CBSAs are some of the biggest ones that over-index on restaurants
	* MSAs that were analyzed were chosen based on fitting two criteria:
		* 1. They had available data not only in the QCEW but also price data in the CPI as well as Affinity spending data in [Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker)
		* 2. They had location quotients for employment, wages, and establishments that were at least close to or above 1.
* How are employment, wages, and establishments faring in these CBSAs from pre-pandemic until now?
* How about consumer spending?
* How about prices?
